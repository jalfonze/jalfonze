*Over two weeks have passed since my departure from The Daintree Rainforest. A place which I am very proud to have called a home away from home. Apart from the historical, cultural and natural aspects of this secluded paradise, The Daintree is not just a location for tourists to maul over and admire, but also a place of serenity for people whose minds have been clouded by whatever struggles they may be going through.*

In my time of reflection, I have thought about all the people that I have met who had made a great impact on my life. The people who have taught me lessons and gave me knowledge and subjects I never knew. The people who inspired me to reignite my old talents and pick up new ones. The people whom I spoke to for hours about life and our journeys ahead. All so subtle yet so significant towards my growth.

Being surrounded with people from different backgrounds with different opinions, it was truly an opportunity to learn more about the different sides of my personality, the ones I never catered for. As well as being immersed in the sub-culture of the locals and experienced their lifestyle, it was truly an eye-opening experience. As I have spoken before in my previous entry, there is no Council supplied power to the rainforest nor is there any water supplied by them. Power was from generators and water was collected from bores or rain. Yet, I met people who chose to live even without power. Back to basics.

It was truly a remarkable experience. Walking along the beach when the tide is out with nothing but the full moon to light the land, taking boat trips to Snapper Island just because it was a warm sunny day, collecting coconuts on the beach to make coconut oil, having drinks and playing music with the locals and travellers alike which highlighted the bond we had as a community.

My time at The Daintree Rainforest was an unforgettable time and I was glad to have embraced every moment since the day I arrived.
