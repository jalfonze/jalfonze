_To all those that want to visit. Please do not climb Uluru. It is not a place to conquer. Have respect for the Anangu as this site is sacred to them._

Beneath the sound of a hundred shutters, I heard the wind as I gazed upon the sky’s colours transform whilst the sun rose from below the horizon.

There it stood. Bold and magnificent. My mind took me to what it could have been like, all those years ago. What it was like for the Anangu to stare at this beautiful landscape, back in those times where life was so primitive and simple. I can only envision the feeling they could have had but it was obvious to me now why this was and still is, so sacred to them.

A natural wonder that could be seen from miles away, so intriguing, as it is surrounded by nothing but a flat surface, decorated by red dirt and desert grass.

**Uluru is not just a rock.**

It’s a meeting place. A source life as when the rain comes, water falls from the crevices creating waterholes at the base. Water holes that vegetate the land and attracts a variety of creatures.

**Uluru is not just a rock.**

It’s a symbol of culture. A place where the Anangu gathered to teach their young of their way of life. Stories which symbolises their beliefs of being at one with the land, how to treat one another in times of celebration, grief and affliction. Where every mark or shape had a meaning, a tale behind.

**Uluru is not just a rock.**

It’s the biggest monolith on this planet solely made out of arkose sandstone. Caused by orogeny and years of erosion.

**Or maybe it is just a rock.**

Just a big red lump in the middle of the desert. With no other significance other than a place to climb and conquer or for businesses to profit out of. A big rock to take pictures of or something just to “tick off your bucket list”.

In truth, there is more to Uluru than it’s picturesque charm. Layers of cultural, historical and geological wonders has been embedded within if you care enough to listen and learn.

Unfortunately not all of us see it that way and for those that don’t. Congratulations. You have just spent your time and money to see a big rock on the desert that has no significance, other than a picture to say you were there. But those that do, it truly is a magical feeling. One that you will carry with you on your travels.
